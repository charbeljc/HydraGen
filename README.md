# HydraGen

**HydraGen** is a tool for automatic generation of Python bindings for C++11 projects using [Pybind11](https://github.com/pybind/pybind11) and [Clang](https://pypi.org/project/clang/) Python bindings.

The name **HydraGen** sucks, but comes from the fact that this tool is born from my frustration with existing bindings
generators while playing with [Hydrogen](https://github.com/hydrogen-music/hydrogen)

Yes, I know, there is no docs.
see [this](examples/Hydra.ipynb) for an example.
